Lately, I’ve noticed the leaves changing color—some are yellowing, and others are even drying out, though the plants are still young. I’m uncertain about what’s causing this; could it be a pest issue, perhaps a fungal disease, or maybe a nutrient deficiency? The soil and rainfall conditions haven’t really changed much from previous seasons. If there’s a specific disease or problem affecting the corn, I’d be grateful for any guidance on how to address it effectively and protect the yield.\""
